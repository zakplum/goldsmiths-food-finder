<b>Goldsmiths Food</b> Finder is a second year Computing Project for a total of 30 credits, developed by Zak and Mark. The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users with specific dietary preferences, such as allergies or religious or ethical reasons, to easily find restaurants near them that cater to their needs.

The project is currently in progress and the deadline for completion is the end of March. Consistent work will be done until that point to ensure the best possible outcome.

The project is built mainly with React.js, HTML, and CSS. It will also use MySQL for databases to store information about restaurants and login information.

Features
- A website that allows users to easily find restaurants near them that cater to their specific dietary preferences, such as allergies or religious or ethical reasons
- A user-friendly interface that makes it easy to search for restaurants and filter results based on different criteria
- A database of restaurants and their offerings to allow users to make informed decisions about where to eat.

The website is simple to use, simply browse through the website and use the search and filter options to find restaurants that suit your dietary needs.

Contributions
- As this is a university project, no contributions will be accepted at this time. However, feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
